What is "version control", and why should you care?
Ever produced a text document, script or datafile with a title looking like this: <em>"FinalVersion2.0_REVISITED18may_FL"</em>?</br>
Version control is a way to organize your scripts in a reproducible, open, and transparent manner, and an additional advantage, you wil no longer produce files with such titles.
More precisely, version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
It is commonly used to manage source code, however, it is also well suited to tracking changes to any kind of file which contains mostly text.

Chances are, you already employ your own version control system, even if you donâ€™t realise it...
Many modern editors such as Microsoft Word and Apple Pages have this facility built in. Also Dropbox maintains a full history of all of the files you have deletes and edited during the last month.

You have almost certainly employed your own simple form of a version control system in the past. Here is an example:
