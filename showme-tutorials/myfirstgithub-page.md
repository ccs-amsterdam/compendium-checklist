This tutorial guides you through the first steps to find your way on GitHub.
Follow the steps below to get comfortable making changes to the code base, opening up a pull request (PR), and merging code into the primary branch. Any important git and GitHub terms are in bold with links to the official git reference materials.

### 1. Install git and create a GitHub account
To start, (a) install git, and (b) create a free Github account. <br> <br>

The first step is to install git.
For this tutorial, we will be using the command line only:
<ul>
  <li> For Windows users, ...  </li>
  <li> For Mac users, use <em>Finder</> to search for <em>Terminal</em> in the <em>Applications</em>. </li>
  <li> For Linux users,  ... </li>
</ul>


Follow the instructions here to install git (if it's not already installed). Note that for this tutorial we will be using git on the command line only. While there are some great git GUIs (graphical user interfaces), I think it's easier to learn git using git-specific commands first and then to try out a git GUI once you're more comfortable with the command.

Once you've done that, create a GitHub account here.  (Accounts are free for public repositories, but there's a charge for private repositories.)
